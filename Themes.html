<h2 class="OdissiDance">Odissi Dance</h2>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odissi , also referred to as Orissi in old literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the temples of Odisha an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women,and expressed religious stories and spirital ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism through songs written and composed according to the ragas & talas of Odissi music by ancient poets of the state. Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu Gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu Goddesses (Shaktism).The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Kalingan temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma), Buddhism and Jainism. It was suppressed under the British Rule. The suppression was protested by the Indians, followed by its revival, reconstruction and expansion since India gained independence from the colonial rule.

      <h2 class="Raja">Raja</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>Raja &#8209;  The festival of the swing</b><br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raja (pronounced as rawjaw) celebrated at the onset of the rainy season is an important festival with a strong social message. The festival is associated with the farmers as the onset of the rains moistens the parched soil making it ready for sowing.
      
      Raja Parba (festival) is also one of the few festivals in the country which celebrates menstruation and conveys the message of empowerment against the societal taboos.
      
      The festival spans three days. The first day is called Pahili Raja (first day), second is Raja and third is Basi Raja (the day after Raja). It is believed that the first drop of rain on the parched soil signifies that Mother Earth undergoes menstruation and all agricultural activities are stopped for three days. On the fourth day, Mother Earth is worshipped, what is locally called as “Basumati Puja”. Just like the Mother Earth, girls of the household are also discouraged from doing household work during the festival.
      
      The entire duration is marked by a festive atmosphere where communities and families come together.
      
      Swings are an integral part of the Raja festival. The swings may be of different varieties, such as Ram Doli, CharkiDoli, PataDoli, DandiDolietc. and crop up in every nook and corner of the street. In some places, swinging competition is held between girls of various villages. The vibrancy of the festival is palpable in almost every Odisha village and city .The festival is also associated with the Odia delicacy of "Podapitha" which is prepared in almost all households. Secondly, chewing of specially made Raja Pan (betel leaf) is a part of culture&nbsp;

      <h2 class="Dhanu">Dhanu Yatra</h2>
    <p><b> Dhanu Yatra&#8209;  &nbsp; The largest open air theatre in the world</b><br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the origin of the unique folk theatre is shrouded in mystery, it got started in the year 1948. This folk theatre is essentially based on Krishna Leela and Mathura Vijay.
      
      What makes this theatre special is that firstly, there are no fixed locations, secondly apart from the lead characters anybody and whoever is in the crowd is expected to chip in, and last but not the least, there are no written dialogues, everything is extempore.
      
      The eleven-day long theatre starts with King Kansa’s accession to the throne, followed by the wedding of his sister Devaki with Basudev and ends when Krishna kills Kansa.
      
      The festival is called DhanuYatra probably because it falls in the month of Pousa(Dec/Jan) which is called Dhanu, and also because King Kansa had invited Krishna and Balaram to the DhanuYatras, as per mythology.
      
      This unique theatre is organized in the town of Bargarh in Western Odisha, which completely transforms itself during the festival. Each year the organizers add a new dimension the theatre to keep the interest levels intact.
